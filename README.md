# Poemly
This project rythmic game created during the Advanced Programming of Interactive Systems course of the Master year 1 in Human Computer Interaction of Paris Saclay University 

## Description :
This game is a one-player game. While it is intended for children, it can be played by people from all ages! 

Choose your game on the menu, your level of difficulty and the poem you want to type. There are three levels of difficulty: easy, medium and difficult. For the easy level, you only have to type lowercase letters. For the medium level, you will also have to type uppercase letters and for the difficult level punctuation is added. 
For the poem, you have the option to choose one of the poems of the game or import your own poem. The poem appears on the right side of your screen so that you can read it. The current letter that has to be pressed is highlighted. 

Once the game begins, your goal is to press the correct key on your keyboard as tiles with letters appear on the screen and fall onto the bar. When the tile touches the bar, you have to click on the corresponding key on your keyboard. Every time you click on the right key, your score increase. Getting all the keys right when the tile is on the bar will get you a score of 100%. Clicking the wrong key will play a distorted sound.
